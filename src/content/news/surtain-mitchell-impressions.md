# Pat Surtain II's Take on the Jets' Hidden Gem

Pat Surtain II doesn’t hand out praise lightly. As one of the NFL’s premier shutdown corners, Surtain has built his reputation on film study, discipline, and a clear-eyed understanding of what separates ordinary receivers from special ones. That’s why his recent comments about Adonai Mitchell stand out.

“I seen him on film and it’s like… this guy is making plays,” Surtain said of Mitchell during his recent Closed Sunday podcast.

His initial thought of the then-Colts WR: “I think this guy’s their best receiver—like, raw talent.”

It’s a striking endorsement, especially considering Mitchell’s reputation to this point. Drafted by the Colts with high expectations, Mitchell’s early career in Indianapolis never fully took off. Inconsistent usage, a limited snap count, and a crowded receiver room kept him from finding a rhythm, leading many around the league to label him a disappointment before he had a real chance to prove himself.

Surtain, however, sees potential for something different on tape – and in the limited number of snaps where he faced Mitchell this Fall.

“We played the Colts this year. Adonai Mitchell. He’s a young cat,” Surtain added, speaking from direct experience. 

He’s got quick releases,” Surtain said. And that natural "giddy-up.”

Those are the details elite corners notice immediately: the way a receiver gets off the line, how effortlessly he accelerates, and whether his movement stresses coverage even when the ball doesn’t come his way.

It’s a telling observation. Receivers fighting for recognition often elevate their game when matched up with elite defenders, and Mitchell appears to have done just that. Now, with a fresh opportunity in New York, Mitchell may finally get the consistent role that eluded him early in his career.

For Surtain, the takeaway is simple: talent doesn’t always show up in stat lines. Sometimes, it lives on film—waiting for the right opportunity.

Mitchell's numbers were on a steady climb in the second half of the Jets' season until the offense stalled out behind Rookie QB Brady Cook.

But he flashed with 300 yards and two touchdowns in a seven game span. If Mitchell lives up to the hype Surtain saw on film, the Jets might have stolen more than just draft picks.
