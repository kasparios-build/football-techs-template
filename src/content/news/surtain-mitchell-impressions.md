# Pat Surtain II's Take on the Jets' Hidden Gem

In early November 2025, the NFL world was stunned when the New York Jets pulled off a blockbuster trade, sending star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts. In return, the Jets received wide receiver **Adonai Mitchell** along with Indianapolis' first-round picks in 2026 and 2027. The deal was a bold move for a Jets team looking to rebuild their offense around young talent, giving up one of the league's top defenders for future draft capital and a receiver many believed had untapped potential.

Adonai Mitchell, the Colts' second-round pick in 2024, had been a disappointment in Indianapolis. Limited snaps and inconsistent production marked his young career — just 32 receptions for 464 yards and no touchdowns over parts of two seasons, including a frustrating fumble on a potential long touchdown in 2025 that cost his team dearly. The Colts, prioritizing a shutdown corner like Gardner to bolster their defense, included Mitchell in the package almost as an afterthought.

Fast forward to Wild Card weekend in January 2026. The Jets, now with Mitchell getting more opportunities in a revamped offense, were preparing for their playoff matchup. Across the league, Denver Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II — one of the best in the game — was watching film in preparation for his own postseason run. Surtain, known for his film study and respect for underrated talent, had faced the Colts earlier in the season and remembered one name standing out: Adonai Mitchell.

"We played the Colts this year," Surtain recalled in a post-practice interview. "Adonai Mitchell. He's a young cat. I seen him on film and it's like... this guy is making plays."

Surtain paused, shaking his head with a knowing smile. "I think this guy's their best receiver — like, raw talent."

He explained that Mitchell's limited film from Indianapolis made him even more intriguing. "His snaps were low, so you don't see a ton, but when he gets the ball... quick releases, natural giddy-up. That speed off the line, the way he accelerates — it's special."

Surtain, who has locked down some of the league's top receivers, knows better than most how less-heralded guys can surprise you. "Less-heralded receivers often bring their best against top corners," he noted. "They've got that chip on their shoulder. You can't sleep on anybody in this league."

For the Jets, Mitchell's fresh start in New York has already shown flashes of that raw talent Surtain spotted. While the trade compensation — two future firsts and a proven corner — raised eyebrows, Surtain's words serve as a reminder: sometimes the real value in a deal is the player no one was talking about. If Mitchell lives up to the hype Surtain saw on film, the Jets might have stolen more than just draft picks.
